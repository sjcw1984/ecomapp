/*
This is a JavaScript function that defines a component in a React application. The component is called "App" and it returns a piece of JSX code that renders a simple web page with a header and a main section.

Here's what the code does in more detail:
- The first line defines a function called "App". This function returns some JSX code that defines the layout of a web page.
- The JSX code is contained within parentheses and curly braces, and it consists of a div element that contains a header and a main element.
- The header element contains an anchor (a) element with an href attribute that points to the root of the application (/). The anchor text is "ecomapp".
- The main element contains the text "List Products", which will be displayed on the web page.
- Finally, the component is exported using the export default syntax. This makes the App component available for other parts of the application to use.
*/

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <header>
        <a href="/">ecomapp</a>
      </header>
      <main>List Products</main>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
